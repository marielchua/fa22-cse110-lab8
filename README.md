Check Your Understanding Q's
1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This makes more sense to be practiced more, since
   this way you can just automatically run tests in a way that won't waste time.
2) No, since end to end testing is about user actions rather than just JS functionality, that would be more unit testing.
3) Yes, since message is a really basic feature of the application that should be tested for functionality in the basic case of sending one message.
4) Yes, like above, message length is a basic feature of the application that should be tested for functionality and can be tested in the basic cases of
   surpassing or not surpassing the limit.
